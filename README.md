# Inventory Management System

Concepts Used: Arrays, switch, conditions, loops
Description:
Simulate a mini inventory system where users can:
- View available products.
- Add quantity to a product.
- Sell a product (decrease quantity).
- Check stock of a product.
Guidelines:
- Use 2 arrays:
- products[] — e.g., "Apple", "Orange", "Milk"
- quantities[] — corresponding stock numbers
- Show a menu using switch:
1 → View All Products
2 → Add Stock
3 → Sell Product
4 → Check Product Quantity
5 → Exit
- Ask for the product name when adding/selling/checking.
- Use loops and conditions to find the product in the array and update quantity.
